https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.1.1-Propellane

"In organic chemistry, propellane is any member of a class of polycyclic hydrocarbons, whose carbon skeleton consists of three rings of carbon atoms sharing a common carbonâ€“carbon covalent bond.[1][2] The concept was introduced in 1966 by D. Ginsburg [1][3] Propellanes with small cycles are highly strained and unstable, and are easily turned into polymers with interesting structures, such as staffanes."

"Surprisingly, the most strained member [1.1.1] is far more stable than the other small ring members ([2.1.1], [2.2.1], [2.2.2], [3.2.1], [3.1.1], and [4.1.1]),[5] which can be explained by special bonding situation of the interbridgehead bond."

Propellane has a 60 degree bond, far less than the 90 degrees in cubane, and the typical 104.5/109 degree bonds.
